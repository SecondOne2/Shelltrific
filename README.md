Like a favour? like a charity, we will be little brothers, you know... homies coders,  my life don't worth nothing without stars in my repos,the doctor prescribe me stars in my repos all the mornings,  right now I'm crying(I'm cutting onions ) , anyway so and if you think that it don't deserve a star, I notice you, that just only for see the gif and visit this repo you owe me a star, lol, is joke (also I'm comedian, I just try it, you know... I say so much stupidities all day, I have to take approach of that,)but yeah, that motivates me to still working, I worked a lot in this , was nights without sleep, so the minimum for this is a simple star, nothing costs you is just a button,  that motivates me a lot to still working in things like this and making open source, due it show me that my repos are helpful,  and I don't wasted my life
